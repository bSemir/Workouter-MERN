# Workouter-MERN
MERN stack application for keeping track of your workout exercises.
#
It's a part of my learning journey where I want to get a better grasp of full stack web development, primarly using youtube tutorials as a resource for this one.

Used: MongoDB, Express, React, Node, Mongoose, React Context, date-fns..
#
I will add JWT Authentication to this project later on.

So far, it looks like this:
